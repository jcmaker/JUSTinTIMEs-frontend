                Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Many students
                define paragraphs in terms of length: a paragraph is a group of
                at least five sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc.
                In reality, though, the unity and coherence of ideas among
                sentences is what constitutes a paragraph. A paragraph is
                defined as “a group of sentences or a single sentence that forms
                a unit” (Lunsford and Connors 116). Length and appearance do not
                determine whether a section in a paper is a paragraph.

                JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as JS, is a
                programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript
                specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time
                compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax,
                dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and
                first-class functions. Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one
                of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.[8] JavaScript
                enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web
                applications. The vast majority of websites use it for
                client-side page behavior,[9] and all major web browsers have a
                dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it. As a multi-paradigm
                language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and
                imperative programming styles. It has application programming
                interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular
                expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object
                Model (DOM).

                  Teachers in leadership positions across New South Wales are
                  being invited to participate in a trial of an online mental
                  health training program developed by the Black Dog Institute.
                  The trial training program, which is recruiting participants
                  from July 2020 to February 2021, is known as BEAM (Building
                  Educators’ skills in Adolescent Mental health) and seeks to
                  equip educators with more confidence to address students’
                  mental health needs.

                  In his book Principled, school leader Dr Paul Browning shares
                  his experience in leading a school that became the subject of
                  one of the hearings of the Royal Commission into Institutional
                  Responses to Child Sexual Abuse, in relation to abuse in the
                  1980s and 90s. Browning – Headmaster of St Paul’s School in
                  Brisbane – says the pivotal events around the royal commission
                  led him to complete a PhD.
